# Lagrange-Interpolation-Numerical-Method-Implementation-in-Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Lagrange Interpolation method for estimating the value of a function at a given interpolating point based on a set of data points. The code reads the data points from an Excel file (`datai.xls`), performs the Lagrange interpolation, and plots the results.
